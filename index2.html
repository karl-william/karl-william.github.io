Jojo Rabbit is a simple film really.
Its recipe is undoubtedly simple, even childish.
It is also something new, and by that the film is quite complex.
It is complex because it says something about the morality of today.
You can agree that it works, or you can argue that it is terribly unfunny, but neither are as true as the fact that it has happened.
So how well does a film work, in which Hitler is a lovable, sympathetic character?
The film focuses on how appearances can be deceiving, not least we are supposed to be challenged by the initial appearances.
I think part of the message is with regards to the appealing facets of fascism.
Fascism will always win the propaganda war so long as people are inherently racist.

The film is rather predictable, but in parts the force of it will knock the wind out of you.
This is a film that needs to be felt, not analysed.

That being said, the film has its flaws. For me, the film should have stopped after a certain gut-wrenching scene.
The last part of the film seemed a little weak, a strange attempt at recovering from and making light of a serious situation.
Was this supposed to be a feel-good film?
Absolutely not.

I think the message there was that nobody would be fascist if we could return to simple human actions, as simple as the dance.
I have no problem spoiling this part of the film, as it is honestly not integral to understanding the rest of the plot.
